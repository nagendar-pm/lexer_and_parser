open the current dir in terminal
follow these instructions then:
1.chmod +x run.sh

It is to be noted that the lex file tokenises the program in "input.txt" written in LAX(LAnguage eXample) language and the yacc file parses it, if any error is found in the input file, parsing is stopped with an error.
For more information on states, Action and Goto elements of the parser, y.output file is to be get in reference with.
